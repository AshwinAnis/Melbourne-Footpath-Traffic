# Melbourne-Footpath-Traffic
There has been a steady decline in the pedestrian numbers throughout Melbourne, especially in the CBD during the COVID-19 pandemic.  With the help of pedestrian sensor devices located at different parts of the city, we obtained the footfall data. Using this data, we determine variations in pedestrian activity throughout the day, week, month etc. Thereby, gaining an understanding of the extent to which the foot traffic in the CBD has been impacted due to the health restrictions.
